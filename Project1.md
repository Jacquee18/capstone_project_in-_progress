# Project 1:

As a lead data engineer at Data Science East Africa, you are responsible for building a data engineering pipeline to move weather data from a public API to Azure Synapse Analytics. You will then use Power BI to access the data from Azure Synapse Analytics and create a modern dashboard.

## a) What are the best practices for moving data from a public API to a data lake? 
Here are some best practices for moving data from a public API to a data lake:

####  i) Understand the API

-Before you start moving data from the API, you need to understand how it works. This includes understanding the following:

1. The authentication process
2. The data schema
3. The rate limiting policies
4. The error handling process

####  ii)Choose the right data transfer too
-There are a number of different data transfer tools available. Choose a tool that is compatible with your API and data lake. Some popular data transfer tools include:

1. Apache Airflow
2. AWS Glue
3. Azure Data Factory
4. Data Pipeline Factory

#### iii) Set up a scheduled data transfer
-Once you have chosen a data transfer tool, you need to set up a scheduled data transfer. This will ensure that the data is transferred from the API to the data lake on a regular basis.

#### iv) Clean and transform the data
-Once the data has been transferred to the data lake, you may need to clean and transform it before it can be used. This may involve removing duplicate data, filling in missing values, and converting the data to a different format.

#### v) Partition the data
 
-Partitioning the data will make it easier to query and analyze the data. Partitions can be based on time, location, or other criteria.

#### vi) Compress the data

-Compressing the data will save storage space. Most data lakes support a variety of compression algorithms.

####  vii) Monitor the data transfer process

-You need to monitor the data transfer process to ensure that it is running smoothly. This includes monitoring the following:

The volume of data being transferred
The rate at which the data is being transferred
The number of errors

#### viii) Document the data transfer process
-You need to document the data transfer process so that it can be reproduced and maintained. The documentation should include the following information:

1. The data transfer tool used
2. The data schema
3. The data transfer schedule
4. The data cleaning and transformation steps
5. The data partitioning scheme
6. The data compression algorithm used
7. The data transfer monitoring process

-By following these best practices, you can ensure that your data transfer process is efficient, reliable, and scalable.

## b)How can we ensure the security and reliability of the data pipeline?
-To ensure the security and reliability of the data pipeline in human simplest terms, you can:

1. Make sure the data is only accessible to authorized users and is encrypted at rest and in transit. This will protect the data from unauthorized access and modification.

2. Monitor the data pipeline for any suspicious activity or problems. This will help you to identify and address any issues early on.

3. Have a plan in place to recover the data if something goes wrong. This could include backing up the data regularly and having a Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP).


Imagine you have a secret diary that you want to keep safe from others. You could:

1. Keep the diary locked in a safe place. This would make it difficult for others to access the diary.
2. Encrypt the diary so that even if someone did find it, they would not be able to read it.
3. Make regular copies of the diary and store them in different locations. This would ensure that you would not lose your diary if something happened to the original.

In the same way, you can protect your data pipeline by:

1. Encrypting the data to make it unreadable to unauthorized users.
2. Regularly backing up the data and storing the backups in different locations.
3. By taking these steps, you can help to ensure the security and reliability of your data pipeline.
